### üß∞ What this workflow does

This workflow analyzes images of resale items, extracts price and brand details, and returns a verdict on whether to buy or pass based on estimated profit. The result is sent to a Discord channel for review.

### Step 1: Trigger the Webhook  
The workflow is triggered when a new message with an image is posted to a specific Discord channel. The message content includes the item price and brand.

### Step 2: Process the Image  
The image is sent to OpenAI for analysis, where the item‚Äôs details are extracted and evaluated.

### Step 3: Send Results to Discord  
The analysis results, including item name, price, estimated profit, and buying verdict, are sent back to the Discord channel for review.
